        <li>Chicken Thighs</li>
        <li>Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>

    <h2>Recipe:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Grind the Walnuts:</strong> Grind 3 1/2 cups of walnuts as finely as possible in a food processor. Once the ground walnuts start to clump together you have reached the correct texture. Be careful not to overprocess as you do not want walnut butter.</li>
        <li><strong>Toast the Walnuts:</strong> Take a non-stick skillet and place over medium heat. Lightly toast walnuts for a few minutes making sure not to burn them, otherwise the stew will be bitter. Pour the ground walnuts into a bowl and set aside until later.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook Onions:</strong> Take a large stockpot or casserole dish with a lid and place over high heat. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil and when it glistens, add 1 finely diced onion. Cook onions until they start to caramelize. Then add 1 teaspoon turmeric and stir into the onion mixture.</li>
        <li><strong>Chicken Thighs:</strong>  Add chicken thighs and sear for a few minutes on each side. Pour in 3 cups of water and add 1 teaspoon cinnamon. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to low to allow the stew to simmer for 10 minutes. Remove the chicken from the stew and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Ground Walnuts:</strong> Pour the ground walnuts into the simmering cooking liquid and stir. Simmer the walnut mixture with the lid on for 1 hour. Stir occasionally throughout to make sure the walnuts do not stick to the bottom of the pan. After the cooking time the walnut sauce should have thickened and darkened in color. There will be a layer of walnut oil on top.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Pomegranate Molasses, Sugar and Saffron:</strong> Bloom 1/4 teaspoon ground saffron in 1 tablespoon water for two minutes. Add 3/4 cup of pomegranate molasses, 2 tablespoons sugar and the saffron to the walnut mixture and stir.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Chicken, Simmer and Season:</strong> Add the chicken back into the stew and simmer for a minimum of 45 minutes or until the meat is falling off the bone. You can pull the bones out at this stage or just serve with the bones. Itâ€™s up to you. The stew will be a rich dark brown color and the oil from the walnuts will form a layer on the stew. Stir, season and taste. Adjust sweetness, sourness and season to taste.</li>
    </ol>
