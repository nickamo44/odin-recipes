    <p>One of my go-to chicken recipes for summer cookouts, these Middle-Eastern style grilled chicken kabobs are wonderful over a bed of rice pilaf or served with a Greek salad. The chicken is marinated in yogurt, olive oil, lemon, garlic and spices, and then grilled over an open flame until juicy and golden brown.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Greek yogurt</li>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Paprika, cumin, cinnamon, red pepper flakes,salt, and pepper</li>
        <li>Lemons</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Boneless Chicken</li>
        <li>Red onion</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Recipe:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Make the Marinade:</strong> In a medium bowl, combine the yogurt, olive oil, paprika, cumin, cinnamon, red pepper flakes, lemon zest, lemon juice, salt, pepper and garlic.</li>
        <li><strong>Prep the Chicken and Thread onto Skewers:</strong> Trim the chicken of any excess fat and gristle. Don’t worry about getting every last bit of fat; most of it will melt off on the grill. Then cut the meat into bite-size pieces. I think it’s easiest to use kitchen shears as opposed to a knife.</li>
        <li><strong>Marinate the Chicken:</strong> Place the kabobs on a baking sheet lined with foil, and then brush the marinade all over the meat, coating well. Cover and let the kabobs sit in the fridge for at least 8 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li><strong>Grill the Kabobs:</strong> Preheat the grill to medium-high heat, grease well, and then grill the kabobs until golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
