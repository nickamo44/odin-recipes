    <p>This is perhaps the most authentic Neapolitan pizza recipe you will find! What’s more, it’s really easy with just 4 ingredients; flour, water, salt, and yeast.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pizza dough</li>
        <li>Pizza sauce</li>
        <li>Mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Kosher Salt</li>
        <li>2 basil leaves</li>
        <li>Semolina flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the pizza dough: Prepare the dough using this pizza dough recipe. (This takes about 15 minutes to make and 45 minutes to rest.)</li>
        <li>Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to 500°F (or preheat your pizza oven).</li>
        <li>Make the pizza sauce.</li>
        <li>Slice the mozzarella into ¼ inch thick pieces. If it’s incredibly watery fresh mozzarella (all brands vary), allow it to sit on a paper towel for 15 minutes, then dab the mozzarella with the paper towel to remove any additional moisture.</li>
        <li>When the oven is ready, stretch the dough into a circle (see How to Stretch Pizza Dough for instructions). Sprinkle a pizza peel with semolina flour or cornmeal, then carefully place the dough on top. Spread the pizza sauce across the dough. Top with mozzarella cheese. Top with a thin layer of fresh grated Parmesan cheese and a few pinches of kosher salt.</li>
        <li>If you’re baking in a pizza oven, add the basil leaves. For baking in a standard oven, skip this step.</li>
        <li>Transfer the pizza to the pizza stone on the pizza peel, then bake until the cheese is melted, about 7 minutes in the oven (or 1 minute in the pizza oven). Allow the pizza to cool for a minute or two before adding the basil on top (whole leaves, lightly torn, or thinly sliced). Slice into pieces and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
